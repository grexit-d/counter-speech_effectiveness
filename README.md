# What Makes Counter-Speech Effective? A Psychosocial Framework for Classification and Evaluation

This repository contains the data of the paper "What Makes Counter-Speech Effective? A Psychosocial Framework for Classification and Evaluation".

We manually annotated two datasets, containing hate-speech/counter-speech pairs, CONAN (Chung et al., 2019), and Twitter Dataset (Albanyan & Blanco, 2022). We release two samples of 100 examples each, taken from both datasets. 

The two samples were used to calculte the Inter Annotator Agreement (IAA) between three annotators. 

- In the [Data](https://github.com/grexit-d/counter-speech_effectiveness/tree/main/Data) folder, there are all the data used for the IAA.
- In the [IAA Results](https://github.com/grexit-d/counter-speech_effectiveness/tree/main/IAA Results) folder, there are the results of the IAA between all three annotators, and divided by pairs of annotators.
- In the [Guidelines](https://github.com/grexit-d/counter-speech_effectiveness/tree/main/Guidelines) folder, there are the guidelines used for the annotation. In order to display them, you have to download the PDF file, and open it on your computer.
