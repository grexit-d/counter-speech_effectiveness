# What Makes Counter-Speech Effective? A Psychosocial Framework for Classification and Evaluation

This repository contains the data of the paper "What Makes Counter-Speech Effective? A Psychosocial Framework for Classification and Evaluation".

We manually annotated two datasets, containing hate-speech/counter-speech pairs, CONAN (Chung et al., 2019), and Twitter Dataset (Albanyan & Blanco, 2022). We release two samples of 100 examples each, taken from both datasets. 

The two samples were used to calculte the Inter Annotator Agreement between three annotators. 

In the Data folder, there are three copies with the annotations of the annotators.
